# Rogue Captain
Rogue Captain is an Oregon Trail and FTL-inspired rogue-lite role-playing game, in which you are the captain of a ship that needs to hunt down the dreaded ghost ship, Lady Dryrot, captained by the terrible Admiral Megdrath, the Gangrene of the Tides, to save all seafaring souls of the Endless Archipelago.

The player's goal is to find and sink Lady Dryrot, which is relentlessly delving deeper and deeper into the heart of the Endless Archipelago, spreading a strange malady all over the seas, that befouls ships and crews alike.
